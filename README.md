Basic site using React that mimics ordering food from a restaurant.

Features:
- page never refreshes (yay React!)
- add multiple items to cart
- view cart
- add/remove items while looking at your cart

To-do:
- Make food items dynamic (ex: restaurant owner changes the menu)
- Store cart information on database rather than local storage
- Add authentication and a login for repeat orders, but still allow 'guest checkout'
